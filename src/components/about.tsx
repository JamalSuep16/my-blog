          <p>
            I started building on the web in 2007 and never stopped. I’ve worked
            in senior engineering positions at organizations like Gatsby (acq.
            Netlify), DigitalOcean, and Khan Academy. I’ve also taught web
            development fundamentals at Concordia University. These days, I'm a
            solo indie hacker focused on empowering up-and-coming software
            developers.
